Project Name:  Exploring Movie Recommender System Using Machine Learning Techniques

Abstract: With the rapid exploration of technological applications, online information have caused confusion among customers. Hence, it seems that developing recommender systems has become increasingly inevitable. Though these recommending systems can predict usersâ€™ preference, boosting the decision making skills of users as well as assisting corporations in a higher profit status, few truly conduct accurate recommendation to users. Focused on the problems of prediction inaccuracy which occurs in many websites, this paper will study the field of movie websites, firstly systematically introducing the main machine learning techniques which are often used in the movie recommendation systems. Then this paper will figure out the similarities and differences of the prediction results by comparing 3 machine learning techniques. The evaluation results finally indicate that the prediction accuracy in this movie recommender system has been efficiently enhanced by Latent Factor Model.
