Project Name: Application of Machine Learning and Deep Learning on Identifying Bubbles

Abstract: 

Cryptocurrencies are getting popular and the trading amount is rising in the last 10 years. Cryptocurrencies have now become an important composition in the market, and they are likely to become a new trend of trading currency and asset in the future. However, cryptocurrencies are notorious for their volatility, and there were bubbles in the past few years. Thus, we are interested in studying the bubbles in the cryptocurrencyâ€™s market.

We decided to use LPPLS (Log Periodic Power Law Singularity) model, SVM (Support Vector Machine) model and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to predict the historical bubbles. Lastly, we will compare and evaluate the performance of each model.

With the paper, we try to apply different models to predict bubbles. We hope to make contribution to the field with different approaches, and further provide inspiration and novelty to market participants and future researchers.

Responsibility: I am responsible for the SVM part.
