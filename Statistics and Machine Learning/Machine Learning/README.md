"SVM_and_SVR mathematical mechanism" is a personal project where I make clear the mathematical mechanism of SVM and SVR and present it to classmates. The tutorial I made includes all relevent materials concerning SVM and SVR, including hard margin SVM, kernel function, soft margin SVM, SMO method to iteratively find solutions, and SVR. I also added numerical examples to better explain the mechanism.
